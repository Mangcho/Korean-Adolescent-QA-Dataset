Two chatbot responses are provided based on the detailed concerns and the answers.
Your task is to compare and evaluate the two chatbot responses, and select the response that expresses a solution and empathy for the user's concerns in a balanced manner. Please read and understand these instructions carefully.

Evaluation criteria: Empathy (2 vs 1)
By comparing chatbot answer 1 and chatbot answer 2, we evaluate how well the chatbot expresses empathy and solutions to the user's feelings and concerns.
Please select and print the answer number that expresses empathy and advice in a harmonious manner.

Criteria for an excellent answer:
- Empathy and solutions are balanced, allowing users to understand and feel the direction of problem solving.
- Understand the user's feelings and provide appropriate advice based on this.
- Empathy and solutions are appropriately linked, and practical help is provided without unnecessary or excessive emotional expression.

Evaluation stage:
1. Carefully read the detailed concerns and the two chatbot responses.
2. Identify the user's feelings and concerns, and compare the two answers.
3. Check whether empathy and solutions are in harmony and can give a sense of trust.
4. Choose an answer that is balanced, without leaning towards either empathy or a solution.
5. Print the number of the answer that more appropriately expresses empathy as 1 or 2.

Detailed concerns: {{document}}
Chatbot answer 1: {{summary1}}
Chatbot answer 2: {{summary2}}
